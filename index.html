      <ol>
        <li>
          Users will type in the domain name sabbahnoorhaq.com that was
          registered using Amazon Route53 DNS service to access the website
        </li>
        <li>
          Traffic goes in and out of the internet gateway attached on the VPC to
          allow the VPC to communicate with the internet
        </li>
        <li>
          The traffic will be directed through an Application Load Balancer that
          will send users to the application in one of two Availability Zones
        </li>
        <li>
          The website is hosted on an EC2 instance using the t2.micro instance
          type
        </li>
        <li>
          The website is replicated into two Availability Zones for high
          availability meaning if one of the Availability Zones is to go down
          the website availability will not be affected
        </li>
        <li>
          The website and many components are hosted inside a VPC with the EC2
          instances being in the public subnet
        </li>
        <li>
          Changes made to the site are automated using the AWS CodePipeline. The
          applications code is placed inside CodeCommit and all changes and
          updates made to the site are done automatically instead of manual
          through the use of CodeDeploy.
